            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen firſt I deſign'd the publiſhing of this Book, I intended only to make a Loyal Copy-Book with this Sacred Subject, the which I ſhall (God willing) with all convenient ſpeed ſo effectually perform, (ſetting aſide the ſubject-matter therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
<pb facs="tcp:93002:5"/> nothing inferiour without vanity to the beſt that have been made heretofore for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Youth; The which Book hath met with a kind acceptance from all (that as yet have ſeen it;) but now for makeing of my work perfect, and for the publique good, I have ventured to go one ſtep further, which is, to publiſh this Book like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Print, having left out in my Loyal Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-Book ſo many powerful; convincing Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture, which conveniently the Book could not contain.</p>
            <p>The great and only Reaſon, why I take upon me, to Print, and publiſh this Book, is [I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain that there was never ſuch an one preſented to publique view before;] nor, (the more to be lamented a more needful time for ſo doing) to convince thoſe wicked Traitorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, (now too plentiful in his Majeſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions) that has the impudence to call themſelves Chriſtians, and yet at the ſame time wilfully denies their Duty and Allegiance to their lawful Soveraign; in denying of which, they moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deny the ſacred Scriptures, and thereby certainly brings upon themſelves (without true Repentance) everlaſting damnation, ſeeing that <hi>Monarchie</hi> is ſo abſolutely grounded on God's
<pb facs="tcp:93002:5"/> holy word, as this Loyal Book evidently makes appear.</p>
            <p>Its likewiſe in my humble judgement, a very neceſſary Book to be made uſe of, by his Majeſties Loyal and Loving Subjects, they being thereby preſently furniſhed with powerful Arguments out of the holy Scriptures, for convincing of ſeveral perſons, who in charity I am bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are really ſeduced by their ſinful Teachers, they knowing no better, than to believe their Rebellious, Deceitful, Lying, Canting ſtories, (murder and ruine, being their true deſign, when ſeriouſly conſidered) for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 Tim. <hi>Chap. 3. Ver. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for thoſe Traitors and Rebels, that ſo wilfully ſins againſt Knowledg, (by all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meanes their falſe hearts can deviſe) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſtill to ſeduce His Majeſties Subjects from their Allegience; My Advice to them is, ſeriouſly to peruſe this Book: For the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> tells them, <hi>(1 Sam. 15. Chap. Ver. 22. 23.)</hi> that <hi>To obey is better than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb facs="tcp:93002:6"/> and to hearken, than the fat of Rams; for Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, (Heb. 10. <hi>Chap. Ver. 26.) If we Sin wilfully, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have received the Knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins, but a certain fearful looking-for of Judgment, which ſhall devour the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> It is my hearty Prayer, that theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Scripture-Proofs (with many more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Sacred Book) may ſo convince them of their errours, that thereby (from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth) <hi>we may lead a peaceable and quiet Life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; 1 Tim. 2 Chap. Ver. 2.</hi> the which we ſhall never be able effectually to obtain, till we have all learned that excellent Precept, given us likewiſe by the Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 2. <hi>Chap. Ver. 17.</hi> To <hi>FEAR GOD,</hi> and <hi>HONOUR THE KING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to conclude this my Advice, (both to Seducers of His Majeſties Subjects, as alſo to thoſe that is blindly lead by them) it is my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to them, ſeriouſly to conſider theſe two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages of Scripture: Deut. <hi>Chap. 32. Ver. 46, 47. Set your hearts unto all the
<pb facs="tcp:93002:6"/> Words which I teſtifie among you this day, which you ſhall Command your Children to obſerve to do, all the Words of this Law: For it is not a vain thing for you; becauſe it is your Life, and through this thing you ſhall prolong your dayes in the Land.</hi> And the other is, <hi>Ezra, Chap. 7. ver. 26. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will not do the Law of thy GOD, and the Law of the</hi> KING, <hi>let Judgment be executed ſpeedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to baniſhment, or to confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goods, or to impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray God, that this my labours may effectually work upon the hearts of all thoſe, who heretofore have either wilfully or ignorantly been Guilty of that grievous crying ſin of Rebellion, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they may become true penitents, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg Gods, and His Majeſties Pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late for ſome of them ſo to do. And ſo I ſhall conclude, with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. <hi>2 chap. ver. 7. Conſider what I ſay, and the LORD give thee underſtanding in all things.</hi> Which is the earneſt and hearty Prayer of</p>

                           <p>7. And now, O LORD, my GOD, thou haſt made thy ſervant King, in ſtead of <hi>David</hi> my Father; and I am but a little Child, I know not how to go out or come in.</p>

                           <p>Ver. 1. LEt every Soul be ſubject unto the Higher Powers: For there is no Power, but of GOD, the <hi>Powers</hi> that be, are Ordained of GOD.</p>
                           <p>2. Whoſoever therefore Reſiſteth the <hi>Power,</hi> Reſiſteth the Ordinance of GOD, and they that Reſiſt, ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Damnation.</p>

                           <p>3. For <hi>Rulers</hi> are not a Terrour to good Works, but to the evil; Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>4. For he is the Miniſter of GOD to thee, for good: But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of GOD; a revenger, to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>
                           <p>5. Wherefore ye <hi>muſt</hi> needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</p>
                           <p>6. For, for this cauſe pay you Tribute alſo, for they be Gods <hi>Miniſters,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding continually upon this very thing.</p>
                           <p>7. Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</p>

                  <head>1. <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 2. Ver. 13.</head>
                  <p>I Give thee Charge in the Sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before JESUS CHRIST, who before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> Witneſſed a good Confeſſion; that thou keep this Commandement, without Spot, unrebukeable, until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Chap. Ver. 26. For if we Sin wilfully, after we have received the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, there remaineth no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93002:54"/> more Sacrifice for Sins, but a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking-for of Judgment and fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, which ſhall devour the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 3. Chap. Ver. 14. For this cauſe I bow my Knees unto the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, of whom the whole Family in Heaven, and in Earth, is named, That he would grant you according to the Riches of his Glory, to be Strengthened with Might, by his Spirit in the Inner Man; That CHRIST may dwell in your Hearts by Faith; that you being Rooted and Grounded in Love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of CHRIST, which paſſeth Knowledg, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Now unto him that is able to do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the Power that worketh in us; Unto him be Glory in the Church, by CHRIST JESUS, throughout all Ages, World without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
